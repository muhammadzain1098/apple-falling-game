# apple-falling-game
This is a scratch project based on concepts of loop , if else and functions.
I have made a game of falling apple in which there are two sprites (apple and bowl) and have two inputs for bowl (left or right)  and for apple(falling and reseting) and teh score increses by +1 after catching the falling apple from the top and it also fulfill the requirements to made the project.
